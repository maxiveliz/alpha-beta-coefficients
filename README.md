# Reproducibility Repository

## Overview
This repository provides the necessary material to reproduce the results presented in the referenced paper.  
It includes **four Jupyter Notebooks** and **four CSV datasets**, which contain the data and code used in the experiments.

## Contents
- `notebooks/`  
  Four Jupyter Notebook files with the step-by-step implementation of the methodology:

    1- _alpha,_beta_coefficients_in_DS1_pynb
  
    2-  _alpha,_beta_in_DS2.pynb
  
    3-  _alpha,_beta_in_DS3.pynb
  
    4-  _alpha,_beta_in_DS4.pynb

- `datasets/`  
  Four CSV datasets used in the experiments: DS1.csv, DS2.csv, DS3.csv and DS4.csv  


## Requirements

The programs in this repository are written in **Python** and provided as **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
You can run them in one of the following ways:

1. **Local execution**
   - Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```
   - Launch the notebook with:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

2. **Execution in Google Colab (recommended)**
   - No installation required.
   - Only a Google account is needed.
   - Each notebook can be opened directly in Colab using the following badge:
